                            What is Python
                            Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It
                            supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy
                            to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
                        <p>
                            Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it
                            attractive for Application Development.</p>
                        <p>
                            Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for
                            scripting and rapid application development.</p>

                        <p>
                            Python is a general-purpose, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It was
                            created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is known for its simplicity
                            and readability, which makes it easy to learn and use. It supports multiple programming
                            paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Key Features of Python</h2>
                        
                        <ul >
                            <li>Easy to use and learn: Python has a clean and simple syntax, making it easy for
                                beginners to understand and write code.</li>
                            <li>Interpreted language: Python code is executed line by line, without the need for
                                compilation, which makes the development process faster.</li>
                            <li>Object-oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to create and
                                use classes and objects to organize and structure your code.</li>
                            <li>Large standard library: Python comes with a vast collection of modules and libraries,
                                providing ready-to-use functions and tools for various tasks, such as working with
                                files, networking, and web development.</li>
                            <li>Cross-platform: Python code can run on different operating systems, including Windows,
                                macOS, and Linux.</li>
                            <li>Extensible: You can extend Python by creating your own modules and packages or by
                                integrating existing modules written in other programming languages.</li>
                        </ul>
